# Create a OTP Login in ReactJS
The inputs should be as usable as possible, specifically:

Each field should allow only one digit between 0-9. Any other input should be rejected
Entering a number in a field should advance the cursor to the next field, except in the case of the last field
Pressing backspace at the beginning of a field (whether that field is populated or not) should focus the previous field and delete the input inside
Very basic styling guidance:
Inputs should be positioned next to one another
Inputs should be roughly rectangular as pictured
Submit button should be positioned below

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
